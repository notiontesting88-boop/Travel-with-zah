There is nowhere on earth quite like the medina of Marrakech. Step through the old city gates and the modern world simply disappears — replaced by a labyrinth of alleyways, donkey carts, and the mingled scent of cumin, rose water, and leather.

I arrived in the late afternoon, which turned out to be perfect timing. The souks were still alive with traders, but the brutal midday heat had softened into something almost pleasant.

## Jemaa el-Fnaa

The great square at the heart of the medina transforms throughout the day. In the morning it is quiet — a few orange juice vendors, some women offering henna. By evening it becomes one of the most extraordinary spectacles in the world.

Snake charmers, storytellers, acrobats, and food stalls appear as if from nowhere. The smoke from hundreds of grills drifts upward into the darkening sky. Gnawa musicians beat their metal castanets in hypnotic, trance-inducing rhythms that seem to come from somewhere deep in the earth.

> "Sit at a rooftop café above the square at sunset. Order mint tea. Watch everything below you. You will not want to leave."

## Getting Lost on Purpose

The medina's streets were not designed to be navigated — they were designed to disorient, to slow you down, to make you stop and look. I gave up on my map on the second day and simply walked.

I found a tannery where leather has been dyed in the same stone vats for 900 years. A spice merchant who spoke six languages. A small riad courtyard hidden behind an unmarked wooden door, where an old man was playing oud to nobody in particular.

## Practical Notes

Stay inside the medina itself, ideally in a riad. The experience of waking up in a traditional courtyard house — with its central fountain and tiled floors — is half the reason to visit.

Haggling is expected and enjoyable once you understand the rules: never name a price you aren't prepared to pay, and always be willing to walk away with a smile.
