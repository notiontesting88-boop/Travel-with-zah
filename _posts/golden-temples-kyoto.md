Japan is a country that rewards the slow traveller. The one who wanders without agenda, who turns down alleys that lead nowhere in particular, who sits with a bowl of ramen long after it's been finished.

Kyoto, more than any other city, embodies this philosophy. It moves at its own pace, indifferent to the tourist hordes and tour buses that pass through. In the early morning, before the crowds arrive, the city reveals its true self.

## Arriving Before Sunrise

We reached Fushimi Inari at 5:30 AM. The gates — thousands of vermilion torii stretching up into the mountain — were empty except for a few joggers and an elderly man sweeping fallen leaves. The wood creaked underfoot. Incense drifted from a small shrine tucked into the hillside.

> "The gates are donated by businesses as offerings, each one inscribed with the donor's name and date. Some are centuries old."

Walking through them in the half-light felt like passing through time itself.

## The Bamboo Grove at Arashiyama

By 7 AM we were at Arashiyama. The bamboo forest is famous for a reason — the stalks rise 30 metres overhead, clicking and rustling in a private language. Sound behaves differently here. The city disappears entirely.

We walked until we found a small path leading to a viewpoint over the Oi River. Cormorant fishermen were already out on the water, their birds tethered by fine silk strings. A ritual unchanged for 1,300 years.

## Practical Notes

The best time to visit Kyoto's major sites is before 8 AM, or after 5 PM in summer. Autumn is particularly spectacular — the maples turn from green to gold to crimson between late October and mid-November.

Stay in a traditional ryokan at least one night. Wake up to a multi-course Japanese breakfast and a view of a raked stone garden. It changes how you understand the rest of the trip.
