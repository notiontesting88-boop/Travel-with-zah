Every photograph you have ever seen of the Taj Mahal is accurate and yet entirely misleading. The scale, the stillness, the way the light changes the colour of the marble — none of it translates. You simply have to go.

I set an alarm for 4:30 AM. My driver thought I was strange. By 5:15 we were at the East Gate, first in a queue of perhaps twenty people. By 5:45, as the gates opened, the sky above the minarets was turning from black to deep violet.

## The First Light

The Taj faces south, which means at dawn the sun rises behind you as you walk through the main gateway. You see the monument in silhouette first — a dark shape against a brightening sky. Then, gradually, it begins to glow.

The marble is not pure white. It is slightly warm, almost cream-coloured, and it catches the morning light in a way that makes the entire structure appear to be lit from within. In the first twenty minutes after sunrise I watched it move through at least five different colours.

> "Shah Jahan built this for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth in 1631. He spent 22 years and the labour of 20,000 craftsmen completing it. He never remarried."

## The Reflecting Pool

The long pool that runs from the gateway to the tomb is not always full — water levels vary by season. In October it was near-perfect, and in the early morning stillness the reflection was almost as beautiful as the monument itself.

I sat on the bench that Princess Diana made famous in 1992 and stayed there for nearly an hour, watching the light change and the crowds gradually thicken.

## What Nobody Tells You

The inside of the mausoleum is surprisingly dark and small. The cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz are surrounded by an intricately carved marble screen. Shoes must be removed or covered. The acoustics are extraordinary — even whispers carry.

The gardens themselves are worth as much time as the monument. Four quadrants representing the Islamic vision of paradise, bisected by water channels. In the early morning they are full of birds.

Get there at dawn. Leave before 9 AM. Return at sunset if you can.
